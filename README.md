# Automatically enrollment of Linux-Surface Secure Boot Key

This package automatically enrolls the machine owner key (MOK) corresponding to the private key with which the kernels released at [qzed/linux-surface][1] are signed.
Note that this package is only relevant in case you are using shim in combination with a compatible bootloader (e.g. rEFInd or patched GRUB).

For more information, please refer to [qzed/linux-surface][1].
